* Abstract

Urban trees are a critical part of the "green infrastructure" intended
to make our growing cities more sustainable in an era of climate
change.  The potential for urban trees to modify microclimates and
thereby reduce building energy use and the associated carbon emissions
is a commonly cited ecosystem service used to justify million tree
planting campaigns across the country.  However, what we know of this
ecosystem service comes primarily from unvalidated simulation studies.

Using the first dataset of actual heating and cooling energy use
combined with tree cover data, we show that that contrary to the
predictions of the most commonly used simulations, trees in a cool
climate city increase carbon emissions from residential building
energy use. This is driven primarily by near east (< 20m from
building) tree cover. Further analysis of urban areas in the US shows
that this is likely the case in cool climates throughout the country,
encompassing approximately 39% of the US population and 62% of its
area (56%, excluding Alaska). Our results add geographic nuance to
quantification of the effect of urban trees on the carbon budget and
could have major implications for tree planting programs in cool
climates.

* Introduction

Two global trends of the 21st century, climate change and increasing
urbanization, have deepened our need to make cities more sustainable,
and urban trees are championed as a means to that end. Several large
cities in the U.S. have recently committed to large tree planting
programs (see Million Trees New York City and Million Trees Los
Angeles). Spending hundreds of millions of dollars, these cities hope
that the environmental benefits, particularly the reduction in
building energy use and the associated carbon (*C*) emissions from
power plants, will outweigh the cost citep:young_2011.

A single urban tree has a much stronger impact on the carbon cycle
than a non-urban counterpart because an urban tree induces or
reduces more C emitting human behaviors than a rural one does.  Both
trees sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but the urban tree
requires more management (planting, watering, pruning, removal,
chipping) and, by modifying the microclimate, it can alter building
energy use and the associated C emissions (*ACE*) from power plants.

Trees primarily alter micro climates by 1) shading, 2) reducing wind
speed, and 3) cooling via transpiration.  With the exception of
transpirative cooling, which is mostly active in summer, these effects
can both increase or decrease ACE.  Shading to the west of buildings
greatly reduces summer cooling loads, but shading to the south of
buildings, even by deciduous trees, may increase winter heating loads
citep:heisler_86.  Reduced wind speeds have complex effects. They: 1)
decrease convective heat loss, which is beneficial for winter heating
but detrimental for summer cooling, 2) decrease air infiltration which
decreases both heating and cooling energy use, and 3) decrease natural
ventilation, increasing the need for mechanical cooling
citep:huang_e_1990.  The strength of the effect of a tree on ACE
attenuates with distance to a building.  Trees far from a house have
little affect on ACE via shading and wind reduction, but they likely affect ACE
via evapotranspiration and the associated reduction in temperature
cite:ziter_e_2019.

Whether the net effect of trees is to increase or decrease ACE depends
on the balance of beneficial and detrimental effects on heating and
cooling energy use. This is largely mediated by the location of tree
cover, the prevailing climate (e.g. number of heating- and cooling-
degree days), building characteristics (orientation, insulation,
size), occupant behavior and the carbon content of a kWh, which varies
depending on the fuel mix in the electrical grid.

* Previous research

Decades worth of research primarily by two research groups, the US
Forest Service's ([[https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/urban_forestry/][USFS]]) Southwest Research Station Urban Ecosystems
and Processes group and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Heat Island
Group ([[https://heatisland.lbl.gov/][LBNL]]), have reported that, on average, trees reduce C
emissions.  In 2002, citeauthor:akbari_2002 published a paper
summarizing their group's findings: "Shade trees reduce building
energy use and CO_2 emissions from power plants".  In 1999,
citeauthor:mcpherson_simpson_99 wrote a technical report that was the
basis of the [[https://www.itreetools.org/][iTree software]], which has been used by thousands of
communities around the U.S. to estimate ACE avoided.  Their
methodology was recently applied to estimate the effects of trees on
ACE for the entire conterminous US citep:nowak_e_2017.  Despite the
number of publications on the topic, the length of time we have been
researching the matter, and the many large cities with massive tree
planting initiatives, our uncertainty about the effects of trees on
building energy use is actually quite high
citep:pataki_e_06,mcpherson_simpson_99.  The effect of trees on nearby
building energy use is difficult and expensive to measure directly and
complex to model.

Direct measures of the effect of trees on building energy use are
rare, focused on cooling energy use, and limited in their ability to
be extrapolated.  To our knowledge, there are the only 5 studies that
test the effect of trees on measured building energy use data
citep:akbari_e_1997,donovan_Butry_2009,dewalle_e_1983,parker_1983,mcpherson_e_1989.
Only two of these studies were of actual houses (not mobile homes nor
models) and both are from Sacramento, CA and did not measure heating
energy use citep:akbari_e_1997,donovan_Butry_2009.  Only one of the
studies was from a cool, heating dominated climate (typical of much of
the US) and it studied a single mobile home in a forest citep:dewalle_e_1983.

Given the challenges inherent in collecting direct measurements,
simulation studies are useful attempts to extend our understanding of
how trees affect building energy use and ACE.  But these simulations
necessarily contain simplifications and generalizations which are
sometimes unrealistic or untestable due to lack of data.

The work from LBNL assumes: millions more trees are planted in an
urban area (extremely ambitious); trees are planted to the west and
south of buildings (ideal placement for reducing cooling loads); and
winter tree canopy transmissivity is 0.9 (0.7 is more realistic,
citealp:heisler_86). In later work, microclimate wind effects are
ignored citep:akbari_konopacki_2005, and in earlier work, they use a
three parameter equation fit to four data points to estimate how wind
speed is reduced by canopy cover
citep:heisler_1990,huang_e_1990. Finally, the LBNL work uses potential
evapotranspiration to predict cooling, and their model uses parameters
derived from crops.  Given these assumptions, the authors note that
their work provides an upper boundary for the indirect effect of trees
citep:akbari_konopacki_2005,huang_e_1987.

USFS studies assume: lookup tables for the effect of tree shade on
building energy use are reliable (even though they may deviate from
more detailed simulations by up to 10%, citealp:simpson_2002); wind
reduction only affects heating use in the winter, even though we know
cooling use is also affected, and they also use an overfit summertime
leaf-on equation from cite:heisler_1990. Evergreen trees are modeled
as if they are windbreaks for rural farmhouses in winter, even in suburban
neighborhoods where other buildings and trees already block
significant winds; and estimated evapotranspirative cooling is optimistically
high, higher even than the self declared upper limit of
cite:huang_e_1987 citep:mcpherson_simpson_99.

The consequence of these assumptions is that simulations may
overestimate the energy reducing power of trees.  What little
validation we have has confirmed the general effects of trees on
energy use that we expect in hot climates, but also highlight the
imprecision of simulations as well as occasional discrepancies from
empirical observations. Simulations of cite:akbari_e_1997 were off by
2-fold, though trees were about twice as beneficial as predicted for
the two houses studied. cite:donovan_Butry_2009 found trees to the
north actually increasing electricity use, unlike the predictions of
cite:mcpherson_simpson_99.

Despite providing estimates for the effects of trees on building
energy use and ACE for anywhere in the country
citep:akbari_konopacki_2005 and the entire country citep:nowak_e_2017,
we still have no empirical validation of the effect of urban trees in
a cool climate.  More than 3 out of every 4 people in the U.S. live in
places with more heating degree days than cooling degree days, and
Americans use much more energy for heating than for cooling
citep:USEIA_2009. To properly assess simulations of the role of urban
trees in the C budget, comprehensive analyses are needed to test the
relationship between tree location and energy usage (both heating and
cooling).  Our work in Madison, WI was the first to begin address this
need. In 2016, we downloaded average annual energy use data for
approximately 32 thousand single family residential homes and built a
regression model between the amount of tree cover near each house and
the C produced from electricity and natural gas use, controlling for
other factors such as building characteristics.

In the summer, trees to the west of buildings provide the most effective shade since solar angles are lower and cooling demand highest in the afternoon.  In winter, even deciduous trees can significantly reduce solar gain.

* Results
** Effect of trees on building associated C emissions
Trees increased C emissions associated with residential building
energy use (*ACE*) in Madison, WI.  This effect was the result of a
trade-off between their electricity (cooling) saving and gas (heating)
penalty.  We estimated that 100m^2 of tree cover within 20m of a house
increased ACE from gas use by 0.77% (95% CI: 0.68%, 0.85%), and
decreased ACE from electricity use by 0.21% (95% CI: 0.34%,
0.080%). Our model for net ACE estimated that 100m^2 of tree cover
increased ACE by 0.17% (95% CI: .09%, .27%).

The magnitude and direction of the effect depended on tree location
relative to the building. Figure [[fig:tree_effect]] shows the percent
change in the ACE from 100m^2 of tree cover.  Trees reduced ACE from
electricity for all near regions except the east.  Trees increased ACE
from gas for all regions, especially in the near south and east.  For
net ACE, tree cover in the near east was the most important, having
the only estimate with a 95% CI that excluded 0.

[[file:../figs/carbon_Percent_coef.png]]

** Effect of existing tree cover on a typical house
The median house in our sample was responsible for 1084 and 954 kg C
annual emissions due to electricity use and gas use, respectively.
Multiplying the median tree cover in each region (see table
[[tab:tree_cover_summary]])  by its coefficient we
estimated the effects of typical tree cover on a typical house in
Madison: electricity C emissions were reduced by 33.8 kg C / yr (95%
CI: 14.7, 52.7), but gas C emissions were increased by 102.3 kg C / year
(95% CI: 92.9, 111.8).  Our combined model estimated the net effect of
existing tree cover is to increase C emissions by about 62 kg C/year
(95% CI: 38.7, 85.3) for a typical house.  This is 2.5% of the median
house's annual ACE.

#+name: tab:tree_cover_summary
#+caption: Summary statistics for amount of tree cover (m^2) in each region around houses in Madison, WI. 
| Region     | min | mean | median |  max |
|------------+-----+------+--------+------|
| near west  |   0 |  193 |    179 |  742 |
| near south |   0 |  372 |    363 | 1443 |
| near north |   0 |  357 |    345 | 1197 |
| near east  |   0 |  193 |    179 |  764 |
| far west   |   0 |  974 |    960 | 2640 |
| far south  |   0 | 1676 |   1653 | 4376 |
| far north  |   0 | 1673 |   1661 | 4602 |
| far east   |   0 |  967 |    955 | 2677 |

While tree cover in far regions had smaller per unit area effects than
in near regions, there was more tree cover in farther regions, so when
median tree cover was multiplied by the smaller coefficients some of
the farther regions had larger typical effects than near ones (figure
[[fig:median_tree_effect]]).  Typical tree cover in the far east and far
west regions had a greater estimated effect than cover in the near
north and near west.

** Comparing C emissions from energy use due to trees to C stored and sequestered.
For comparison, consider a green ash tree with a crown area of
100m^2.  This tree would store approximately 1360 kg C in above ground
biomass and it could sequester around 34 kg C / year.  That same tree in
the near east region of a typical house in Madison was estimated to
increase C emissions by 9.8 kg C/yr (95% CI: 6.7, 12.9).  In the near
west the estimated effect was 1.0 kg C/yr (95% CI: -2.1, 4.1).

* Discussion
** Interpreting Tree Effects

In the cool climate city of Madison, with 7283 HDD and 597 CDD and a
electricity emission factor of 0.206 kg C / kwh, the effect of trees
on ACE was clear: trees increased ACE from gas use more than they
decreased ACE from electricity use, resulting in a net increase in
ACE.  This result suggests that shading was the most important process
and that whatever gas savings trees may have provided in winter by
reducing wind speeds was swamped by the penalty in reduced solar
radiation.

By separating tree cover into different locations, it appeared that
for the most regions, the beneficial effects of trees on electricity
ACE /mostly/ canceled out the detrimental effects of trees on gas ACE,
with the exception of the near east.  This suggests that trees to the
east may have been responsible for most of the net increase in
ACE. Eastern trees did not provide electricity savings since houses
require less cooling in the morning hours, but still caused an
increased gas use in winter.  This agrees with cite:donovan_Butry_2009
who also found trees to the east had no effect on electricity use.

As expected, trees to the near south had a strong effect on
electricity savings, but they also had a stronger gas penalty.
Trees in the near west and near north had the weakest gas penalty,
which may have been due to the savings they provided by reducing
wind speed. Somewhat surprising was the weakness of the estimated
electricity savings of trees in the near west, which all simulations
have predicted has the strongest effect.

** Comparing to past work

Our findings agreed with some though not all of the past simulation
studies, and the modeling of wind is the main cause of
discrepancies. cite:thayer_maeda_1985 modeled the shading effects of
south trees on building energy use and reported that trees increased
emissions in cities with more heating degree days than cooling degree
days.  cite:mcpherson_e_1988 investigated the shading and wind effects
on building energy use in 4 cities, one of which was Madison, WI.
Converting their results into C, trees in Madison caused a small
increase in emissions, though their method for modeling wind was later
criticized and abandoned citep:simpson_mcpherson_1998.
cite:akbari_konopacki_2005 developed a method to predict the effect of
a tree planting program and increasing roof albedo for any city in the
U.S. Figure [[fig:akbari_konopacki_2005]] illustrates an application of
their method to every census tract in the conterminous US for
pre-1980s houses using updated energy emission factors.  About 40% of
the US population live in areas where the cite:akbari_konopacki_2005
model predicts that trees increase C emissions.  While their methods
were limited as mentioned above, and they modeled theoretical, not
existing, tree cover, their work suggests that many large cities
especially in New England, the Northwest, the Mountains and the Upper
Midwest would need to carefully consider the C implications of large
tree planting programs.

#+caption: Each census tract in the conterminous US shaded by magnitude of building C emissions effect of trees planted to west and south of a pre-1980's home and increasing roof albedo.  Differences in regional emission factors (C/kWh) cause deviations from climate trend.  New England has especially high ACE for the climate because their electricity is cleaner (low C/kWh).  About 40% of Americans live in places where trees increase ACE. Model based on cite:akbari_konopacki_2005.
[[file:../figs/akbari_konopacki_2005_netkgC_wCities_3.png]]

Our empirical findings disagree with those simulation studies that
model the relationship between tree cover and wind speed following
cite:heisler_1990 and cite:mcpherson_simpson_99. When the beneficial
effects of wind are excluded for models of several cool climate
cities: Toronto citep:akbari_taha_1992, Chicago
citep:jo_mcpherson_2001, Minneapolis, Sacramento, and Washington
citep:huang_e_1990, trees either have no effect or increase energy use
and ACE, which agrees with our general findings.  The iTree model of
cite:mcpherson_simpson_99 predicts that the shading effects of a large
deciduous tree in the Norther Tier, North Central, Mountains, Pacific
Northwest, and California Coast regions increases ACE of a 1950-1980
vintage house by 0.136 to 9.52 kg, depending on the region.  This is
comparable to our results.  However, the wind effect in the iTree
model of that same tree on the same house decreases heating ACE by
1.23 to 66.14 kg depending on the region and existing canopy: an order
of magnitude greater savings for gas ACE from wind reduction than the
penalty from shading.  However, our model coefficients derived from
measured gas use suggest shading is a more important process than wind
shielding.  cite:mcpherson_simpson_99 note that the uncertainty in
their methods was high, and, given our contradictory findings, it is
clear that more data and improved models are needed to better
parameterize the complex and uncertain relationship between tree
cover, wind, and building energy use.

** Considering the larger C cycle

The effect on ACE of a tree with a 100 m^2 canopy area is an order of
magnitude smaller than that tree's C sequestration.  However, it is
important to make the distinction between different pools of C.
Discounting increased ACE as irrelevant because C sequestration more
than compensates, fails to recognize that ACE is an input of
fossilized C while sequestration is a temporary transfer of C from the
atmosphere to biosphere.  In the short term, sequestration may assist
in climate change mitigation, but unless forested land is permanently
expanded or wood products are forever prevented from decay, in the
long run (hundreds of years) sequestration by trees can never offset
fossil C emissions.  Indeed this same conclusion was made for
fossilized C emissions due to tree management citep:nowak_e_02.  The
avoided ACE from trees had been estimated to more than offset these
management emissions in a life-cycle analysis of the Million Trees Los
Angeles program citep:mcpherson_kendall_2014.  However, our results
suggest that for cool climate communities, shade trees actually
increase ACE and, especially when combined with the C emissions from
management, are atmospheric C sources in the long term.

*** COMMENT cite:nowak_etal_2010 failed to make this distinction.

** Trees relative to other factors that affect ACE and the ACE effect of trees relative to other ecosystem services/disservices.

Considering all of the factors that determine building energy use and
ACE, trees play a very minor role, which we estimated to be about 2.5%
of the ACE of a median house.  As buildings become better built and
insulated the effect of trees on ACE will decrease.  Far greater ACE
savings are possible with improved construction and savvy occupant
behavior. However, the effect of trees on energy use and ACE is one of
the most often cited ecosystem services of trees citep:roy_etal_2012,
and evidence that ACE is increased by trees highlights the large
uncertainty in software used by thousands of communities to justify
urban forest costs.

Still, effects on ACE are just one of the ecosystem effects that trees
have in cities.  Trees may also improve air quality, reduce stormwater
runoff, reduce noise, and provide wildlife habitat.  The aesthetic
value of trees is often far greater than the value of the ecosystem
services or disservices provided citep:mcpherson_e_05.  Even after
publishing that trees reduced ACE on average, cite:akbari_2002 noted
that this benefit alone may not justify the cost of tree planting.
Our opposing results have a similar caveat: even after finding the
detrimental impacts of trees on ACE in cool climates, management
decisions need to consider these results as just one of the many
benefits and costs of trees.  Our results suggest that trees planted
on all but the near east side of a house are net neutral in terms of
ACE, so that the other benefits of tree planting, such as aesthetics,
could be accomplished in cool climates through careful selection of
planting locations.

** Future work

Using actual energy use data from over 25,000 houses, we provide a
much needed complement to simulation models of tree effects on ACE in
cool climates.  However, there is need for continuing work to address
remaining shortcomings.  The observational nature of our data is
strengthed by the size of the dataset, but ultimately causal inference
depends on our physical knowledge of how trees alter building energy
use.  More experimental studies are needed especially in cool climate
cities to better understand that relationship.  Not all coefficients
in our model agree with our existing physical understanding of how
trees affect building energy use.  For example, it is surprising that
trees to the near west have such a weak effect on electricity use. Our
data on tree cover was also limited by a lack of information about
tree height, which means we could not address how adjusting the size
of trees planted in an urban area affects ACE. Incorporating lidar
could provide more accurate estimates of tree shading and wind
reduction.  Furthermore, the scale of the effects that our study could
detect is much smaller than the city-wide effects many simulation
studies address.  Ultimately, this work is a sample of one year from
one city with the accompanying limitations.  The warm December during
the sampling period may mean the effect of trees is even more
detrimental than we report, but more years are needed to say.  The
location of Madison near the boundary that cite:akbari_konopacki_2005
identified between trees being a sink and a source is useful, but more
cities are needed to empiracally determine this boundary.

Our work reveals a blind spot in urban forest ecosystem studies.  In
an extensive review of the effect of the urban forest on CO_2
emissions, cite:weissert_etal_2014 did not consider that trees could
increase ACE.  In a paper critical of many ecosystem services provided
by trees, cite:pataki_etal_2011 nevertheless state that trees reduce energy
use and ACE.  While this may be true in most of the US, and the
potential ACE reduction is larger than the potential ACE increase, it
ignores geographical nuance citep:akbari_konopacki_2005.  In many ways
it is not surprising, given the climatic diversity across the country,
that the effects of trees on ACE might also vary and that our
prescriptions for how to plant trees to minimize ACE could be
different between Los Angeles and New York City.  However our study is
only the first study to use both gas and electric energy use
observations, and the first study of its kind in a cool climate.  Much
more work with observed energy use is needed to identify the border
between atmospheric C sink and source.

*** COMMENT What about evapotranspirative cooling? the issue of scale.
What about evapotranspirative cooling?  We may have a bit of a scale
issue here.  I doubt we'd have enough independent observations at the
scale necessary to assess this.  Also the newer houses with fewer
trees still have grass (maybe even better irrigated) and they are
closer to the rural areas (farther from the built up interior of the
city).  I think the results show that we don't see at the local scale
an effect that is stronger than the detrimental effect on heating.
But the larger scale question is still oppen.  Also, the itree model
has the trees having a local scale effect.

* Conclusion
Using observed energy use data, we have shown that trees near
residential houses in Madison, WI increase energy use and associated C
emissions and near east tree cover has the strongest net effect.  Extending
past simulation studies, we show that this is likely the case for a
large area of the US.  The magnitude and direction of the effect is dependent on
tree location relative to buildings, climate, building
characteristics, occupant behavior, and the C content of electricity.
Disagreements between our results and past work is due to how wind
effects are modeled and much more work is needed to better understand
this process.  We add critical geographic nuance to research that
could have major implications for tree planting programs in cool
climates.

* Methods
** Building Energy Use
In April 2016, we obtained the annual energy use summary table (April
2015 - April 2016) from Madison Gas and Electric's publicly available
website for approximately 32 thousand single family residential houses
in Madison, WI.  This included average monthly gas and electricity
use.  This period exhibited a much warmer than average December (about
6º C) and had low snowfall.  We removed from our sample outliers that
used fewer than 120 therms (which is less than the 0.5% quantile) or
fewer than 240 kWh (which is less than the 0.05% quantile) annually.
We included only buildings that used natural gas for heating and had
central air conditioning.  Our final sample size used to build models
was 25095.

** Carbon Emissions

We converted energy use to C emissions using emission factors
published by the US EPA's Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated
Database, eGRID citep:eGRID.  100% of the carbon in natural gas is
oxidized to CO_2 when burned for heating. The carbon coefficient for
natural gas is 1.446 kg C / therm citep:epa_a2_2017.  For electricity,
Madison, WI is a part of the Midwest Reliability Organization East
(MROE) region of the North American electric grid.  The estimated
carbon coefficient for power generated in this region is 0.2063698 kg
C/kWh citep:eGRID. We had originally used emission factor for MROE
from 2012 (.1567988 kg C / kWh) and by switching to the updated and
higher 2016 emission factor (0.2063698 kg C/kWh), the overall
detrimental effects of trees on ACE was diminished from about 3.4% to
2.5%.

** Building Characteristics

Energy use is strongly determined by building characteristics.  For
every address in the city, the City of Madison releases the assessor's
property information, which includes information on building age,
size, materials, type of heating and cooling, as well as which schools
serve the address.  We removed any houses that had bad or missing
data.  Many of the covariates, such as size and price, were strongly
correlated.  Given that our primary interest was how tree cover
affected building energy use, not how building characteristics affect
building energy use, we reduced the dimensionality of building
characteristics using principal components analysis.  This reduced the
number of building covariates from 20 (Lot area, length of water
frontage, year built, number of stories, number of bedrooms, number of
bathrooms (full and half), number of fireplaces, living area on each
floor, finished attic area, finished basement area, total basement
area, crawl space area, year roof was replaced, number of stalls in
each garage, land value, improvement value) to 5 orthogonal vectors,
accounting for 55% of the variance.

** Tree Canopy
For tree cover we used a 1m resolution landcover map derived from 2013 National
Agriculture Inventory Program (NAIP) visible and near-infrared digital
aerial imagery (Erker et. al, in review).  Using building footprints
from the Dane county, for each house for which we had energy use data,
we divided the space around it into 8 regions defined by 2 buffers
around the house of distance 20 m and 60m and 4 rays from the
building's centroid.  Tree cover closer than 20m was considered near,
tree cover farther than 20m and closer than 60m was considered
far. These buffers were subdivided into north, west, south, and east
regions by rays of angles 57, 123, 237, 303 degrees from north.  These
angles are within 1 degree of the azimuth angle of sunrise and sunset
at the two solstices.  This defines the south region as the region
that is exposed to direct sunlight year-round, and the north region as
the region that is never exposed to direct sunlight (this relationship
is approximate and complicated by individual building geometry).
Within each of the eight regions we summed the area covered by trees,
and then use the tree cover in each region as predictors in our
models.

We tested buffers of different widths (every 3m from 3m to 60m), but
found because of the observational nature of our data that we needed
to aggregate regions to remove multicollinearity that caused
unstable coefficient estimates.  Using a distance of 18, 21, or 24 m
instead of 20m to separate "near" from "far" cover only slightly
changed coefficient estimates.

** Building Cover

Nearby buildings likely also affect the energy use of a building.  To
test this hypothesis we calculated the area of buildings in each of
the eight regions around every building and included these as
covariates in our modeling.

** Modeling

We fit linear models where the response was log transformed annual ACE
for gas use, for electricity use, or for gas and electricity combined
(net).  Because a separate model was built to explain net C emissions,
coefficient estimates for the net model were not precisely the sum of
the coefficients from the electricity and gas models. ACE was log
transformed to meet assumptions of normality and diagnostic plots were
assessed to check other model assumptions and potential sensitivity to
influential observations.  Our first models aggregated all tree cover
near buildings into one variable, and subsequent models separated tree cover based on
direction and distance into eight variables.  The first models tested the overall
association of tree cover with energy use, the second models sought to
parse out distance and directional effects.  In addition to tree
cover, variables in our model were: 5 principal components of building
characteristics, building cover in each of the 8 regions, and a random
effect for elementary school which might capture neighborhood
characteristics such as culture.  We used AIC as a variable selection
criterion and in our final models only used the first 5 building
characteristics principal components and we dropped all the building
cover covariates.  Estimates for the coefficients of tree cover were
not sensitive to the inclusion or removal of these covariates, but
model fit improved.  Although some tree cover covariates increased
AIC, we kept all tree cover covariates in the model because we wanted
estimates of their effects, however uncertain they might be.  We also
fit models We fit models using the R package lme4 citep:bates_e_2015.

** Interpreting coefficients
To improve interpretability of coefficients, we back transformed them
to the original scale and expressed the multiplicative effects as a
percentage citep:gelman_hill_2007.  We then multiplied this percent
change by the median ACE (a better estimator of the central tendency
because of the right skew in our data) to estimate the typical effect
in absolute C terms.  To get typical effects of tree cover, we
multiplied median tree cover in each region by its coefficient
estimate and back transformed to the original scale.

** Estimating C storage and sequestration of a green ash with 100m^2 canopy
To estimate C storage and sequestration by a single green ash tree with a
 canopy cover of 100m^2, we used allometric equations to estimate that
 tree's diameter at breast height (DBH) and mass and then, assuming an
 annual DBH growth of 0.61 cm, predicted the change in mass to get C
 sequestration cite:nowak_crane_2002,mcpherson_e_2016.

** Extending Analyses from Published Literature

To compare our work to past simulation studies we converted results
that were in Therms or kWh to kg C.  We did this for
cite:thayer_maeda_1985, cite:mcpherson_e_1988, and cite:huang_e_1990
using updated emission factors corresponding to each study city's
eGrid subregion citep:eGRID.  To extend cite:akbari_konopacki_2005, we
joined climate data (heating and cooling degree days) from the nearest
NOAA weather station to census tract centroids
cite:tract_centroids,arguez_e_2012.  Then for each census tract we
predicted the effect of trees and increasing roof albedo on the energy
use of a pre-1980's building with gas heating following their table
that bins houses according to heating degree-days and using emission
factors corresponding to the eGrid subregion containing the census
tract centroid. Separating out the indirect effects of trees from the
indirect effects of increasing roof albedo was not possible because
these were not modeled separately. However, the general trend would be
similar, but with a decreased electricity savings and a decreased
heating penalty.  cite:akbari_konopacki_2005 found the effect of tree
shade to be stronger than the indirect effects of increased roof
albedo and transpirative cooling.  We also used the join of climate
and census tract data to estimate approximately 77% of the
U.S. population lives in places with more heating than cooling
degree-days.
