The carbon budget of the urban forest is not important because it's
magnitude.  But

1) The modeled results show that trees increase C emissions for the
   majority of the country
2) There is considerble/some uncertainty in the modeled results,

start big picture, then narrow down to details

1) Trees affect C emissions from energy use
2) On average they increase C emmissions
3) C emissions from Heating increased more than C emissions from
   Cooling Decreased
4) Location matters:
   1) Near trees have stronger effects than far trees
   2) for heating (gas), trees to east and south cause greatest increase
   3) for cooling, trees to south and north cause greatest decrease,
      to west a slight decrease, and to east perhaps an increase.
5) Cost; because C in gas is cheaper than C in electric, although C is
   increased on average, cost there is little effect.  Trees in near
   east may have slight increase in cost.

"Based on average state energy costs in

estimated to reduce energy costs from
residential buildings by $360,000 annually.
Trees are estimated to slightly increase the
amount of carbon released by fossil-fuel
based power plants. However, this estimated
increase in emissions (1,200 tons) is more
than offset by annual carbon sequestration by
trees (25,200 tons)."
cite:nowak_e_2017 cite how the trees save money, but don't mention how
they increase C emissions.  In their table 4, IL has significant
heating and cooling savings.  Something is not consistent...

  :END:
Canopy cover explains less than 0.5% of the variation in carbon
emissions.  As a strategy to reduce building emissions, altering
canopy cover will have little effect.  However, canopy cover does have
statistically significant effects on emissions and these effects are
also ecologically significant - on the order of magnitude of the C
sequestration by tree canopy.

Models were built on the log scale, so coefficients are multiplicative
and can be roughly interpreted as the percent change in emissions
associated with changing from 0 to 100% canopy cover in a region around a
building.  For example, a coefficient of 0.02 when back transformed to
the scale of the original data gives e^0.02 = 1.020201, an increase of
about 2%.  The absolute effect changes with the base level of energy
used. So canopy has a smaller effect on small houses and a larger
effect on large houses.  The median C emissions for the houses in the
study is 173.48 kg C/ mo, 2% of this 3.47 kg C/ mo or 41.6 kg C /yr.
So coefficients of 0.02 indicate that adding trees to this region
cause a change in emisssions of 41.6 kg C/year in the median case.

The regions that significantly affected C emissions sometimes agreed
with my hypotheses, but were often surprising.  For C emissions from
electricity use, regions close to the buildings had strong negative
effects, as expected.  However, the region to the east and between
10-20m had the strongest effect and it was positive.  This was
unexpected and the cause is not clear.  For C emissions from gas use
regions to the south and east and far from buildings had positive
effects.  Unexpectedly the region just north of buildings had a
positive coefficient.  In addition to some of these surprise
relationships, many regions that I expected to have stronger effects
did not.

There are a number of next steps for this research.  I need to do more
work to explain the unexpected pattern in model coefficients, perhaps
by adding more covariates such as the location of nearby buildings and
environmental covariates such as elevation and distance to the lakes.
I need to apply the model to the actual distribution of tree canopy
around buildings to estimate whether the effect of our positive or
negative on C emissions.  I need to add the dollar value associated
with this energy use.  Since the price of energy depends on the season
and time of day it is used, there is not a linear relationship between
cost of energy and C emissions.  Therefore canopy may have a stronger
or weaker relationship with energy cost than with C emissions.
Finally, I need to work to parse out the postive effect of canopy on C
emissions from gas and the negative effect of canopy on C emissions
from electricity use.  How might switching to electric heat or
switching the mix of fuels to generate electricity shift the balance?

Reduced wind speeds can
cause both increased or decreased heating or cooling energy use
depending on the season and weather conditions.

Trees modify human behavior.

"in 1987...  cite:mcpherson_e_1988... " acutally maybe this isn't the
best way to do this because mcpherson has written much more since that

We need to focus on carbon.
Also where most americans live.

I need to know if Itree takes climate into account (hdd and cdd).

- convert cost to energy.  Then take the energy and assume the range
  of possible C emissions (heating from different sources, electric
  from different sources) to set the bookends to cover all the places
  that acutally get their energy from a mix of places.

- Carbon is the key thing.
- The urban forest is a C source (over much of the US)
-

In addition to using cite:mcpherson_e_1988 to show that trees cause
emissions.  I could probably do the same with Simpson's Look-up
table.  I might be able to get national, population weighted estimates
using his lookup table: cite:simpson_2002



I should think about replicating the modelling study so that I can
plot in space the line between C source and sink.

4 panel figure: each panel is a map showing the strength of the C
source or sink due to a tree near a building.  Each panel will be a
cardinal direction.



"the typical introduction of a paper about urban trees gives a laundry
list of their benefits and ecosystem services....


This paper replicates the results from a modelling exercise 30 years
ago that showed trees increase building energy use, but the
significance was overlooked.

bias for positivity: ecosystem services over disservices (I can
probably find a relevant citation in a paper that talks aboud disservices).

make sure i'm not making a straw man

many times the paper is just giving examples of dnisservcies (not
trying to exhaustively list them).  Therefore it's not always fair to
blame them for excluding that trees can potentially increase energy
use as a disservice.  However, it is fair if that paper includes
energy use reduction as a service..
- for a similar reason it's not exactly fair to crticize papers that
  are just talking baout ecosystem services.  But the fact that many
  exist that don't consider the disservices show the immaturity of the science.


Bigger picture is that we need to consider all of the ways that trees
affect the carbon cycle.

We have had the understanding that trees can have both positive and
negative effects on air quality for a long time.  It is time that we
bring that nuance to the effect on the carbon cycle.

While trees increase C emissions, they have a smaller effect on energy
bills.  This is because the cost of C derived from electricity (
$/kgC) is more than the cost of C derived from gas ( $/kgC), which
weights the savings effect of trees on electricity.  For the median house in our
sample with an annual energy bill of $1800, 100m^2 of tree cover in
each of the regions is estimated to only increase the bill by $3.54
(95% CI: $0.27, $6.82).

Americans live where trees are a net C source.

One of the points changed from summer to winter.......  thinking about
it more this is probably because that point just has buildings, no
trees.  That's why the canopy cover is so low.

There is no cold climate validation.  Wind reduction is what makes
trees beneficial in cold climates, but it's foundation is weak.

  said that...... who....
- reduced wind was assumed to only be positive cite:mcpherson_simpson_03

  cooling (but this method is considered outdated by more recent papers)

In the discussions of papers the negative effects of trees are
mentioned, but models might omit them or be overly optimisitc for the
positive effects.

LBNL - method of extrapolation from 5 test cities might have a lot of noise.

- donovan might be best (but sacramento and just
electricity);  The balance between the positivie and negative effects
trees have on heating and cooling is what we really don't understand.

the key question is not how trees affect building energy use, but
where the balance is.  How do the counteracting forces balance?  Where
is the line in climate space?


modelling
- shade
- wind (some had it then, it was dropped)
  - cite:parker_1983 - note importance of wind for cooling.
  - cite:akbari_e_1997 - their trees reduce sun and wind, but there is
    still net reduction, actually more than their models predicted.
  - the heiseler equation for summer is used to describe how trees in
    winter reduce wind.  probably off by about 10% given the figure in heisler.
- evapotranspiration

cite:akbari_e_1997 - only test of simulations - off by two fold.

ours is the first heat data also.

using trees to alter energy use goes back to 1940s cite:bates_1945

cite:nowak_e_2017 - apply energy model to the whole (maybe just much
of) the US.  Building on a weak foundation.

uncertainty
- lack of data
- simulations

heating versus cooling

in cite:akbari_2002 - philly
cite:nowak_etal_2010 - chicago increase

results from cite:donovan_Butry_2009 donovan show that trees to north may increase electric
use in summer (not included in simultions)
.

All this means that

Because management activities cause a transfer of fossilized carbon to the
atmosphere/biosphere system, unless the amount of C

cite:akbari_2002 - even with ideal planting conditions for energy use,
they don't think these benefits alone justify the cost.  But these
benefits are what are key to the forest being a C sink.  (that's not
fully logical because C and $ aren't the same).

Work from two research groups has found that the sum of these
sometimes counteracting forces on C emissions by trees is by in large
a reduction, and this research has been the scientific foundation upon
which tree planting campaigns have been based.  The first group is the
....

akbari's group gives upper boundary of indirect savings
cite:akbari_konopacki_2005 - "It is important to notice that in all our
previous calculationsweassumedthatallurbansurfaceswould be modified to
the levels discussed above. This provided an upper boundary for
estimates of indirect saving potentials. "


there's adifference between ideally placed trees and how trees really
are: see the chicago studies.

** key ideas
- The carbon budget of the urban forest.
- urban trees influence our behavior.
- Though we have known that urban trees are sources of C for decades,
  we ignore this in literature.
- write out the C budget for urban trees and then highlight the most
  important parts.
  - the parts that interact with the lithosphere are most important if
    we consider timescales longer than the time it takes for all the
    carbon a tree has sequestered to return back to the atmosphere
    (the order of 10s to 100s of years for almost all trees).
    - I should verify this for treated lumber
    - how long to our wooden frame buildings last?
  - unless there is a permanent expansion of stored wood (more area forested
  - magnitude of trees effect on C emissions is small compared to
    other changes that could happen on building (more efficient
    appliances, better insulation), but compared to sequestration and storage


- We have known for a long time that trees can actually cause increase
  in C emissions in some places
- But we have ignored it
- Here we show that for Madison this is the case
- and argue that this is more typical of the relationship between
  trees and building C emissions than elsewhere.

- There is far greater uncertainty that we think
  - reviews miss the key effects of trees
  - bias by climate
  - the effect via wind?  many papers mention the effect in winter,
    but cite:mcpherson_e_1988 show the strong effect in summer.
- I think this is the first observational data on heating energy use.
  And on top of that in a city that is closer to the typical climate
  of the US than other cities studied.

** brain storm
- what is the relevant timescale for a C budget?
  - how many tree lifetimes?
  - 100 years?
  - 300 years?
  - at what point will the economy be so different or new technologies
    have developed to make this calculation nonsense?
- There has been a lot of work accounting for the amount of carbon
  stored and sequestered in the US - though not perfect it gives a
  good idea.
  - but this is actually not the most important part of the carbon
    budget of the urban forest.
  - Human management of the urban forest and it's ability in turn modify
    human behavior via building energy use is the important part
- what is the role of urban soils?
  - consider the tree contribution
- trees can affect air temperature and humidity which alters energy use.
- propose a simple but coherent model as a first step
- I need to get some numbers
  - for some typical/representative individual trees
    - sequestration
    - storage
    - management emissions
      - planting
      - pruning
      - removal
    - building energy use (this is an interaction w/ existing climate).
      - shading
      - wind
      - evapotrans
    - soil?
  - for some municipalities
    - number of trees managed
    - budget
    - amount spent on fuel.
    - convert this into dollars and C per tree.
- just as sequestration and storage is a function of climate (precip,
  growing season length, etc), the effect of trees on C emissions
  associated with building energy use is a function of climate.
  - also type of building
  - location of trees relative to building.
    - look at madison data to see if there are any trends
      - yes there appears to be.
- find literature from million trees NYC that says trees save C
  emissions. (because in that climate they may not).
- shift to more C efficient electricity makes the effect of trees on
  reducing C from a/c less.
- wind is key.  Look at the UFORE publications for northern cities.
  This seems to make the trees reduce energy use, but I think/want to
  investigate the validity of the wind assumption. look at cite:mcpherson_simpson_99
- How many papers consider the increase in humidity that is associated
  with trees?
- a key part is the uncertainty associated with each part of the
  equation.
  - for example cite:simpson_2002 's look-up table is within
    +/- 10% of more detailed simulation.  This adds error on top of error.
  - wind, uncertain.  how does wind affect hot climates?  do others
    find whaat cite:mcpherson_e_1988 found?
  - Think about creating a figure similar to cite:pataki_etal_2011
  - But UFORE and ITREE makes people think we are far more certain.
- should I include the methane emissions from power plants also?
  There is carbon in them as well, but it's a relatively small amount
  and makes things more complex.  but i should think about it.
- a key thing is weighting by population.  For most people, what is
  the effect of trees?
- Trees can have the strongest effect on cooling C emissions, but most
  of the country has more heating related emissions.
- from cite:thayer_maeda_1985 and cite:mcpherson_e_1988 it seems trees
  can cause increases in C emissions in a number of circumstances.  What
  are the assumptions that later work makes to show trees reduce
  emissions moreso?
- Humidity really is a huge part of the equation.
- We have known about the negatives of trees
  for heating for a long time (cite:thayer_maeda_1985,heisler_86).
  But Many papers (from mcpherson and simpson) show that the positive
  effects of trees reducing cooling load out weights the negative of
  increasing heating load.  What if the balance isn't quite what these
  simulations suggest?
- climate things to consider
  - temp
  - wind
  - clouds and when clouds occur in day
  - solar radiation (this could encompase clouds)
  - humidity
- I also need to consider that many of the houses in Madison may not
  have AC.  This could be a reason why the electric savings is not as
  much.  cite:simpson_mcpherson_1998 take this into account - see fig 3.
- I'm not saying anything that other researchers don't already know.
- key point in cite:simpson_mcpherson_1998 about how the wind effects
  in cite:mcpherson_e_1988 may not be realistic because the wind was
  modelled in the absence of shading.  So no wind and the building is
  getting hit by solar radiation instead of no wind and the building
  is being shaded.  There is likely an interaction.
- So far I see two groups modeling: mcpherson, simpson, heisler et al.  and
  akbari, huang, taha et al.
- I need to look for recent papers that have tried to model this
  stuff.  But I don't think they exist, becuase none of the recent
  reviews have seen them.
- the different approaches taken for modelling wind reductions might
  explain differeences between cite:mcpherson_e_1988 and
  cite:huang_e_1990.  cite:mcpherson_e_1988 don't model the affect of
  trees on wind; just model the effect of wind on E use and say they
  think wind might be reduced by 75% in a neighborhood with dense
  vegetation.  This is not too far from what cite:heisler_1990 found.
- we know that trees have both postiive and negative effects on energy
  balance.  Simulations suggest that net, trees are good (reduce
  energy).  But in many climates this amount is very little.  And if
  we account for the uncertainty, the effect could very well be
  negative.
- what is the sensitivity of the simulations to building
  characteristics?  Location of trees? etc?  Furnace and A/C
  efficiency?  Energy Source?
- there is considerable uncertainty in the relationship between tree
  cover and wind speed.
- this is interesting because there are so many opposing effects
  (shading versus wind; heating versus cooling)...it's a fine balance.
- For my data, I may or may not be including Evapotranspiration, since
  at larger scales at which ET may act there may not be enough
  variability or range in ET.  Maybe there is, but the signal might be
  weak.  it would be hard to parse out this contribution.
- million trees also planted in LA for 1984 olympics, but many didn't
  survive cite:akbari_taha_1992.  Interesting especially since
  cite:huang_e_1987 (which akbari and taha are authors on too) found
  that trees have little benefit in LA since energy demands are
  already so low.
- realizing that trees don't do that much good for the environment, at
  least relative to reducing emissions from transportation and
  buildings, is a bummer.  Having to share that is like telling a hard
  truth to a good friend.
- is the wind part of the ufore model peer reviewed?  I need to find
  this if it exisits....
- simulating the effects of trees on wind is hard, but not as hard as
  the effects on humidity and temp.  cite:mcpherson_e_1994.
  - they struggle with the temp effect especially.
  - may be one more reason why empirical data is needed.
- the significance is not in the magnitude of the effect, but in the
  magnitude of our uncertainty (unknown unknown.)
- it's my impression, and i might be wrong, that almost all the papers
  tht cite these energy papers just do so as evidence of ecosystem
  services.  They aren't a part of a critical debate trying to improve
  our estimates or understanding.
- my work doesn't take into account the broad scale effects of trees
  on the urban climate which might affect energy use.
  - much of this work like from akbari is in hot places where reducing
    the uhi is good.
  - is there anyone who has shown that a uhi in winter reduces heating
    energy use?
  - the deciduousness of trees is nice here, in summer there's the ET
    which cools when needed.  in winter deciduousness allows light to
    heat hard surfaces.
- i've tried very hard to show that trees aren't as beneficial in cold
  places as we often think.  If it turns out that they really are
  beneficial, then I'd be even a stronger supporter.
- That wind primarily affects heating seems like a misconception
  (actually not, it is generally true, but miami is a notable exception).
  - cite:simpson_mcpherson_1996 say this
  - papers that show wind has stronger effect on cooling than heating:
    - cite:mcpherson_e_1988 - maybe their method is old.
    -
  - is there a paper that shows wind has stronger effect on heating
    than cooling? yes cite:huang_e_1990
    - ../figs/huang_e_1990_windC.png
    - for all cities but miami, wind has stronger effect on heating
      than on cooling.  For Phoenix, the differeence is smaller.  For
      most cities, the heating effect is many times the cooling effect.
- the work that the forest service has done to quantify the costs
  and benefits of trees is pretty incredible.  I'm pretty impressed.
- there has been decades of work on this subject and many
  publications, but all this seems to build on relatively few studies.
- the vast majority of studies are simulations
- in the case of cite:akbari_e_1997
- tree ecosystem services have be calculated in XXX cities.  Many
  cities investing large amounts of money in green infrastructure.
  There have been dozens of publications on the matter.  But when it
  comes to energy use there is acutally large uncertainty.  We have
  very few measured studies and they aren't represnetative.  WE have
  simulation studies, but we know they can be off by large amounts
  (two-fold).  The margin between trees being a net cause of ghg
  emissions and sink of ghg emission (via building e use) is within
  this uncertainty certainly.  We simply don't know because we don't
  have the data to say so, yet we act as though we are certain.
  - the forest service researchers are very aware that sometimes trees
    can be negative, but sometimes that is glossed over.  Maybe it
    depends on their audience?
- dollar savings from trees for electricity can be even greater if the
  region has peak rates (high price) during times of most use, summer.
- there's a lot of work built on a small foundation, because building
  the foundation is very challenging/expensive.
- the wind equation from cite:heisler_1990 used by cite:simpson_1998
  and I think itree folks, is based on 4 data points (neighborhoods)
  and contrained to cross the origin.  It has 3 parameters.
  - Could I get the data and fit a model and report the uncertainty?
    This might be hard to do because the uncertainty come from the
    model form part.  It's not the regular regression uncertainty.
  - But there may be a way to quantify this, though I'm not sure how
    helpful it would be.
- that trees increase nighttime temps might actally be worth
  publishing.  Read pg 101 of cite:mcpherson_e_1994
- temperature reduction due to trees ET could also be greatly improved.
  - little empirical data
  - potential evapotranspiration instead of actual.
    - use crop et
  - grass versus tree ET
- the distribution of heating and cooling equipment in homes is important.
- highlight the great and large amount of work that the forest service
  has done, but the large uncertainty that remains.
- "heating penalty can be substatial even in cooling dominated regions" cite:mcpherson_simpson_99

- given that we know cite:nowak_e_02, that in the long run the
  management of trees causes C emissions, transfer from lithosphere to
  atmosphere/biosphere; we need them to offset this transfer.  This is
  why their effect on building emisssions is so important.

    Trees Los Angeles Program https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/46311

    probably don't justify the costs.
- everyone should have a big tree to the west of their house if it
  doesn't negatively impact a neighbor's house (regardless of climate).
- trees can have a very strong effect in hot places.
- trees are not bad, it just shows they aren't as good as we thought
  they were.  Chopping down trees won't help us much either (even if
  all the wood is prevented from decomposing).  Trees just don't
  affect energy much and with improved building standards they are
  affecting buildings even less.  We need to focus on more important
  things or plant trees for other reasons, recognizing they may be a C source.
- more energy is used for heating than cooling in the US
- I could figure out how many times cite:mcpherson_simpson_99 was
  cited and how many times the papers that cited it were cited to get
  an idea of the impact.  Same with cite:akbari_2002.

** COMMENT recycle text

While almost all studies that follow the cite:mcpherson_simpson_99
methology find that trees reduce ACE on average (e.g
cite:nowak_e_2017), one exception is cite:nowak_etal_2010, who found
that trees in Chicago increased ACE.  They then state, "However, this
estimated increase in emissions (1,200 tons) is more than offset by
annual carbon sequestration by trees (25,200 tons)."


The role of C/kwh:
as seen in [[fig:akbari_konopacki_2005]], whether trees are beneficial or
detrimental is largely a function of climate, but also of the C
content in a kWh for different subregions of the grid.

NY state has higher ACE because their electricity is cleaner (less C/kwh), Illinois
and Missouri have lower ACE because their electricity is dirtier (more
C/kwh).

It's a sad irony that as electricity becomes cleaner, trees become
less beneficial, even detrimental cite:jo_mcpherson_2001.

heating and cooling energy in LA: http://www.energyatlas.ucla.edu/about/overview

https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/53420

does cite:akbari_konopacki_2005 deal with wind reduction for cooling?

Summarizing some thoughts so far:

iTree depends on:
1) cite:mcpherson_simpson_99 primarily
   1) windbreak - heisler et al. 1979
   2) wind reduction - cite:heisler_1990 - 4 points and 3 parameters
      1) cite:akbari_taha_1992 - they use this wind relationship.
         find in canada that it drives the savings
      2) later work by akbari excludes the wind effect, which in hot
         places would likely increase energy use.  in cite:akbari_2002
         he talks about the effect of wind, but it is only simulated
         in cite:akbari_taha_1992, not their later work.  They mention
         they have unpublished work that shows evergreens to north of
         buildings would be good.
      3) cite:mcpherson_simpson_99 also use heisler 1990 as base.
         1) they also don't allow the reduction of wind to increase
            cooling costs.  It only affects heating costs
      4) so there is a miss match between how we know the process
         works and how we model and report results.
   3) temperature reduction - there are a range of papers that they
      cite that show about .5 - 2 degree C reduction with 10% increase
      in tree cover.  The
      1) cite:simpson_1998 's sensitivity analysis show that the
         cooling savings from temperature reduction from trees could
         be half or 3 times within the range of reasonable parameter
         values for the effect of trees on temperature and sensitivity
         of buildings to that temperature
      2) cite:huang_e_1987 Potential Evapotranspiration and crops.
         Sets the very upper limit of cooling.
      3) cite:konopacki_akbari_2002, and similar papers, all get their
         methods from cite:taha_e_1996
      4) those that have actually measured air temperature
         1) cite:sailor_e_1992 - not peer reviewed.  "Sailor and
            others (1992) estimated a decrease of 0.36  ̊C/10 percent
            cover increase on the basis of regression analysis of
            measurements at 15 residential locations scattered
            throughout Sacramento. Cover was determined for  ̃40 ha
            areas surrounding each measurement location; substantial
            scatter was observed in the data." - cite:mcpherson_simpson_99
            1) there really was a lot of noise
         2)
   4) look up tables used in iTree can be off by +/- 10% from the more
      detailed simulations, which themselves have unknown uncertainty.
   5) do the figures in cite:akbari_konopacki_2005 show the
      variability

2 groups:
1) Forest Service (mcpherson, simpson, heisler); -
   1) advocate for trees
   2) so potential tree bias
2) Heat Island Group Environmental Energy Technologies Division,
   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
   1) trying to find ways to reduce the urban heat island.
   2) so potential hot city bias.









Root problem: uncertainty: simulations not agreeing, models built on
little data (because hard and expensive to get).

We have good reason to think simulations are wrong by a fair bit.


see this for how many trees were feasbile to plant in million trees
LA:  https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/29402
far less than akbari susggest to get the cooling benefits.




I think the iTree may be over generous, especially regarding wind
effects which can only reduce energy.  but other papers don't have
that.  I think wind is just hard to model.  they have wind breaks, but
would those really matter in cities?

"heating penalty can be substatial even in cooling dominated
regions" - cite:mcpherson_simpson_99


iTree depends on lots of parameters that are maybe reasonable, but
maybe not because they aren't backed up by data.  e.g the temperature
effect of trees.

If there weren't opposing forces (trees having opposite effects on
heating and cooling via shade and wind), this wouldn't matter as
much.  But changing


trees affect via:

1) shading - blocking shortwave solar radiation
   1) simulation studies show that shading can increase carbon
      emissions in cold, heating dominated climates
   2) cite:heisler_86,thayer_maeda_1985,mcpherson_e_1988
   3)



When the sensitivity analyses (e.g. cite:simpson_1998) show




a recent empirical study:

cite:roy_etal_2012
cite:pataki_e_06


http://www.itreetools.org/streets/resources/Streets_CTG/PSW_GTR199_Midwest_CTG.pdf
- in the midwest, the majority of the benefits from trees are energy
  savings (56%), next is property value increase (24%).  This kinda
  surprises me, since I think in other papers I've seen that property
  value increase is the great majority

cite:givoni_1991 - this is a good review from a long time ago. covers papers i've read
about temperature.  nothing about energy use.



cite:pataki_e_06 - see notes and page 4

cite:nowak_e_02 - management causes emissions that, in the long run
the trees can never reverse.  However, this is sometimes ignored or
glossed over:  FIND EXAMPLES . Management is not the only ghg
emissions associated with the urban forest: also tree's effect on
building energy use.
cite:mcpherson_e_2015  - just looked at 50 years out;  they note
importance of wood products instead of mulch
,luck_e_2014



https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000084
- only electric/cooling?
- in akure nigeria (maybe they never use heat anyway and this isn't
  notatble)

need to find papers that don't mention heating in places where heating
is important.

do mention:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231400081X#sec3



maybe we do know that trees can increase heating use (there are 125
papers that cite cite:mcpherson_e_1988 and most seem to note that
fact), but I don't think this is put in terms of carbon.

cite:akbari_2002

cite:mcpherson_simpson_99
- see pg 212

cite:mcpherson_simpson_03

cite:pataki_e_06

cite:pataki_etal_2011 - they don't mention the potential for trees to
increase energy use.  (though i really like the paper).  Even this
paper which takes a critical look at services and disservices misses
the potential for trees to increase C due to icreased heating.  They
say the effect of trees on ghg emissions has high uncertainty, but it
is even higher than they recognize.

essa list, always posts for sunny houses.  Do you ever think those are
being posted in especially shady neighborhoods?  Why say sunny? I
think it's because many apts aren't that sunny?  Why aren't they
sunny? Other buildings and trees.  We value trees, but we also value
sunlight.  Keep that in mind.  (this would need to be made incredibly
eloquent and concise).  Find picture of house that is "sunny" and
google map where it is surrounded by trees.

trees change our behavior (by changing how our houses use energy)




"Have you ever had to sit down with the love of your life and tell
them that they aren't doing all they can to help fight climate
change?"
I'm not talking about a heart to heart with your significant other, or
an awkward thanksgiving dinner.  I'm talking about my love, urban
trees.

I am obsessed with trees in cities.

Beautiful.  We control them, but in some ways they affect us back.
Energy Use.

That's what I'm talking about with the trees and climate change.  The
key point of my talk is that the trees near our houses in Madison are
actually causing us to use more energy and this is leading to more C
emissions.

The rest of my talk I'm going to explain how I came to this conclusion
and the nuance behind the bottom line.

1) methods
2) more detailed results.
3) so what/discussion.
