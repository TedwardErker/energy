If you are sitting in the audience of the wisconsin ecology spring
symposium, there is a good chance someone at some point in your life
has called you a tree hugger.  If you are like me you enjoy being in
their presence and you came of age hearing about all the benefits they
provide us.  Cleaner air, reduced storm water runoff, carbon sequestration

#+BEGIN_NOTES
What is the net effect of trees on C emissions from building energy
use?  Varies by location.....  At some climate there's a switch.

When you have two effects that are opposing, it is really important to
reduce uncertainty around each one so that you know what the net
effect is.


My key question:

Do trees near houses in a colder place like Madison cause them to emit more or
less C?

Not all the coeffients make strong mechanistic/physical sense.  But if
you summarize across all regions the effect is very clear
statistically.

That said, I wanted to see if this might be true more genearlly.  or

It's not that surprising given the climatic variabliity of our country
that there isn't a one size fits all approach.  Trees aren't even
native to LA and planting them strains limited water resources.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
While our results are intriguing because the direction of the effect
is not what you might expect, the magnitude of effect is none or
small, depending on location

Tree in a bad spot isn't causing too much harm, but also planting a
tree won't significantly offset your emissions.

there are other things you can do that are far more effective that
worrying about trees... getting energy efficient appliances or hang
drying your clothes, for example
upgrading your refigerator could save around 25 kg C/year
air drying clothes over 100 kg
be smart about thermostat

Also, reducing C emissions is just one of the benefits trees provide.

conclude by showing this figure again....

On average across the country trees likely reduce C emissions, but we have
shown that existing simulation models actually predict significant
geographic variability in the effect of tree on C emissions that is
often disregarded.  Our work provides the first empirical
corroboration of such simulations in a cool climate city.  While the
effect of trees on C emissions is ultimately small relative to other
interventions, our work could have major implications for tree
planting programs in other cool climate cities where about 40% of the
US population lives.

wind especially for leaky houses can decrease cooling need and
increase heating need.  trees good in winter, bad in summer (opposite
for shading).

"Trees act as windbreaks that lower the ambient wind speed, which may
lower or raise a building’s cooling- energy use depending on its
physical characteristics. In certain climates, tree shelterbelts are
used to block hot and dust-laden winds. In addition to energy-saving
potentials, this will improve comfort conditions out- doors within the
city. Through wind shielding, trees affect a building’s energy balance
in three ways:

1. Lower wind speed on a building shell slows the dissipation of heat
   from sunlit surfaces. This in turn produces higher sunlit surface
   temperatures and more heat gain through the building shell. This
   detrimental phenomenon (during the sum- mer) is significant only
   for uninsulated buildings.

2. Lower wind speed results in lower air infiltration into
   buildings. The reduction in infiltration has a major impact on
   reducing cooling-energy require- ments for old and leaky houses.

3. Lower wind speed reduces the effectiveness of open windows during
   the summer, resulting in increased reliance on mechanical
   cooling." - akbari 2002.

Urban Humanity

Viewing the earth from space, the lights of our cities are
unmistakable.  The fact that most of us humans are now urban dwellers
heightens the importance of urban ecology as a field of study that
strives to make our cities and by extension the planet more livable.

** if I'm asked:
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Depressing but realistic conclusion that planting trees in cold parts
of the country is an activity that almost always results in the
emission of fossilized C getting to atmosphere.  Tiime and effort
should be spent elsewhere.

#+END_NOTES
** Urban trees $\longleftrightarrow$ human behavior 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A single urban tree has a much stronger impact on the carbon cycle
than a non-urban counterpart because an urban tree induces or
reduces more C emitting human behaviors than a rural one does.  Both
trees sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but the urban tree
requires more management (planting, watering, pruning, removal,
chipping) and, by modifying the microclimate, it can alter building
energy use and the associated C emissions (*ACE*) from power plants.

* Judges comments

Personally, I was proud of how I did.  I prepared a bunch and hit
pretty much everything that I wanted to as I wanted to.  I did not get
in the top 2 of 7 talks, but it was a great opportunity to share my
work and get things together for this part of my defense.  The
feedback from the judges was also great.


I thought my work was really good and I was confident, even hoping I
would win.  But these events are a reminder of just how many smart and
talented people there are

I'm surprised more didn't find it visually appealing, but maybe they
are just harsher.  I'm a good explainer.


I accept that chance can play a large role in scoring.  Judge 1 and 2
were close in scoring, but judge 3 scored me very highly.  I'd have to
look across presentations to see if this was ......


What I would change:
1) Thinking about how to make it more visually appealing, I like the
   simplicity/minimalism/plainness and I like the dark background which
   makes colors pop, but maybe remove the all caps from the titles.
   Maybe make more of the images background images (magnolia, festival
   foods) rather than inserts.
2) 


** Judge 1
"interesting contrast of winter vs summer shading. presented the
overall issue and need for more understanding but I would have
appreciated a clear research question from the outset.  Would have
preferred a bit more detail about the model built: intriguing results
and nice explanation of those figures.  Nice job putting the Madison
example in larger context.  Good explanation at the end of how this
matters big picture."

"Good pacing of presentation. slides were relatively plain but clear,
and maps/figures were well done and well presented."

Lots of nice feedback, thanks

improvemnets/ suggestions
- clear research question from outset
- more detail on the model
  - I should for sure do this.  I omitted because of time and I think
    I misjudged my audience.  Maybe I don't find it all that
    interesting of a model so I gloss over it, but I owe it to my
    audience to explain more.  Log(C) so multiplicative model which
    can be interpreted as precent change.  Used pca to compress
    building covariates, random intercept for neighborhoods (school districts).
7/10 on visually appealing

** Judge 2
"Very good questions, broad approach to problem"

** Judge 3
"Excellent! Nice analysis, great visuals.  The final results aren't
exactly super exciting, but it's nonetheless worth work and you've
done it well."
